\title{Update Filenames in Links in Files within a Directory Tree}
\usage{
update_links_filenames(
  oldFileName,
  newName,
  dirTree,
  settings,
  fileExtensions = list("Rmd")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{oldFileName}{Character string of the basename of the file, including prefix
and extension of the old filename to be replaced. Must not contain spaces.}

\item{newName}{Character string. The new name to replace the old filename. Must
not contain spaces.}

\item{dirTree}{Character string. The path to the root directory containing the
files to be updated.}

\item{settings}{List. Configuration details, including the \code{ProjectPrefixSep}
and \code{VolumesDir}.}

\item{fileExtensions}{List. A list of file extensions to include in the search
(e.g., \code{list("Rmd")}). Defaults to \code{list("Rmd")}.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value but modifies files in place as necessary.
}
\description{
Updates references to a specific filename in files within a directory tree,
replacing the old filename with a new name. This includes replacing the
corresponding links within the file contents. Processes specific file
extensions and excludes certain directories from processing.
}
\details{
This function identifies all files matching the specified extensions in the
directory tree. It processes each file, searching for links or references
that match the \code{oldFileName}, and replaces them with the \code{newName}.

The function ensures:
\itemize{
\item Both \code{oldFileName} and \code{newName} do not contain spaces.
\item Excluded paths (e.g., configuration or volume directories) are not processed.
\item Links are reconstructed using the project prefix and the provided settings.
}

Files are updated in place, and any changes made are logged to the console.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Ensure that both \code{oldFileName} and \code{newName} do not contain spaces.
\item Files are modified in place. Backup your directory before using this function.
}
}

# Update file references in Rmd files within the directory
