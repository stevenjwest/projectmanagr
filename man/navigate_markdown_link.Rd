\usage{
navigate_markdown_link()
}
\description{
This function looks for a Markdown link on the currently selected line in RStudio
(or subsequent lines if the link is split) of the form \verb{[...](...)}. Once the path
is identified, if there's a \verb{#header} portion, the function opens the file, searches
for the matching header, and navigates there in RStudio. If it doesn't find such a
header, it raises an informative error.
}
\details{
To keep this function short and readable, much of the logic is moved to internal
helper functions:

\itemize{
\item \code{parse_link_in_selected_line()} extracts the path (and anchor, if any)
from the userâ€™s selection, handling multi-line links.
\item \code{navigate_file_with_anchor()} opens a file and navigates to the
specified anchor.
\item \code{navigate_file_no_anchor()} opens a file if one exists, or checks
for an internal heading in the current file.
}
}
