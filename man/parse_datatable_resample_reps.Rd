\title{Parse a Resample datatable with reps SOURCE sample IDs}
\usage{
parse_datatable_resample_reps(dt_vector, datatables, table_name)
}
\description{
This will generate the new datatables from a resample dt_vector that contains
set of REPS SOURCE sample IDS.  This means the SOURCE SAMPLES consist of two or more
REPLICATES.  To uniquely identify the replicates, a second \code{rep} column is presented
next to the \code{ID} column to denote each REP within each ID.
}
\details{
When resampling samples which contain REPS, each ID/REP will be given as a new entry,
and \code{resample} and \code{reps} columns will be added.  The resample vector is given in
each ID/REP row - with each resample code given in adjoining rows for a given ID/REP.

Further reps can be made of each ID/REP from the parent sample!  And these reps are
entered into the \code{reps} column.

Importantly, when the subsample datatable/tibbles are made they are named according to
the parent resample CODE PLUS the parent resample rep, separated by a dash.

eg. From \code{samples_SC-CER} datatable, if these samples were resampled with code
\verb{100µm}, and ID \code{1001} had 4 reps created, if this was further resampled with
a new vector (eg. it was split into \code{LT} and \code{RT} sections), then in
\code{samples_SC-CER_100µm} each ID/REP would have its own line (1001/1 1001/2 1001/3
1001/4), and each entry would have a resample column with \code{LT} and \code{RT} in it.

THEN when this resample table is read, new datatable tibbles will be created, with
names: \verb{samples_SC-CER_100µm-1_LT} \verb{samples_SC-CER_100µm-1_RT}
\verb{samples_SC-CER_100µm-2_LT} \verb{samples_SC-CER_100µm-2_RT} etc.  These will
contain ID \code{1001} and represent each new subsample of each 100µm rep!
