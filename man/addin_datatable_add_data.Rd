\title{Add Data to Existing Samples in a New Datatable}
\usage{
addin_datatable_add_data()
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string representing the file path of the current R Markdown document.}

\item{contents}{A character vector containing the content of the current R Markdown document.}

\item{row}{An integer indicating the row number where the cursor is positioned in the document.}
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It modifies the R Markdown document by adding data to an existing sample datatable
or updating the ADD_DATA template at the cursor position.
}
\description{
Generates a Shiny Gadget for adding data to existing samples in a new datatable,
with various layout and data selection options. The user can select a datatable name,
layout, and data to add, and then the new data is inserted at the cursor position
in the current R Markdown document.
}
\details{
This function allows the user to:
\itemize{
\item Select an existing datatable from a list of available datatables in the current Rmd.
\item Choose the datatable layout (samples, variables, or timetable).
\item Select the ID format for data addition: "ALL", "all-IDs", or a group set.
\item Define the column names, with special handling for datetime columns (denoted by the suffix \verb{_dt}).
\item The function will then insert the appropriate ADD_DATA table at the cursor location, based on the layout selected.
}

If the cursor is already inside a valid ADD_DATA template (one that has a recognized layout such as sample, variable, or timetable),
the user can simply select the existing datatable and IDs to add, and the ADD_DATA table will be updated with the selected IDs.
