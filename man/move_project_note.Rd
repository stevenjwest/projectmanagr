This Function moves a Project Note
}
\details{
adds a Protocol to a Project Note - protocols are found in the
 PROGRAMMES' protocols/ Dir.

Inserted protocols add each Procedure defined under the '# PROTOCOL' section
 of the document. Notes sections (FALSE by default) and the Equipment section
(TRUE by default) can be optionally included in the inserted protocol.

All links in the Protocol are UPDATED to work from the destination Project
 Note.

All graphics included in a knitr::include_graphics() r code chunk are
 transferred to the new Project Note DIR and linked appropriately.
