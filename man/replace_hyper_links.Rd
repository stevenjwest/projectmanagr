\description{
Rewrites markdown hyperlinks that point to files, converting them from paths relative to
\code{sourceFilePath} to paths relative to \code{destinationFilePath}. Internal header-only links
(e.g., \verb{#section}) and non-existent file links are skipped. All valid links on each line
are processed.
