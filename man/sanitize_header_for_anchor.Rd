\title{Sanitize Markdown Header for Anchor Link}
\usage{
sanitize_header_for_anchor(txt)
}
\arguments{
\item{txt}{Character string. The raw header text from a Markdown section (e.g.,
\code{"My Special--Section!"}).}
}
\value{
A character string representing a sanitized anchor. All characters are
converted to lowercase, sequences of non-alphanumeric characters are replaced
by a single dash (\code{-}), and leading or trailing dashes are stripped.
}
\description{
Converts a Markdown header string into a standardized anchor format
suitable for internal hyperlinking, following rules similar to those used
by Pandoc when generating HTML IDs from headers.
}
\details{
This function is a core utility for generating internal section links between
\code{.Rmd} files in the \code{projectmanagr} package, ensuring that links to specific
headers (e.g., using \code{#my-section}) match the actual anchors created
during R Markdown rendering.
