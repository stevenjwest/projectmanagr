\description{
This function generates markdown content for a daily journal log. The log is divided into three sections:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Programme Strategic Objectives} – extracts objectives from programme index R Markdown files.
\item \strong{Today's Events} – creates a placeholder section for events from Google Calendar.
\item \strong{TODO Items} – adds a section for TODO items.
}
}
\details{
The function performs the following tasks:
\itemize{
\item It creates a Date object using the provided year, month, and day.
\item In \strong{Section 1}, it lists all R Markdown files in the "programmes" folder, searches for the "# Strategic Objectives" header, and extracts the subsequent lines until the next header is encountered. The file name is included as a subheading.
\item In \strong{Section 2}, a placeholder section for "Today's Events" is added. Currently, it outputs a message indicating no events are scheduled.
\item In \strong{Section 3}, a section for "TODO Items" is appended. The function calls an (assumed) \code{extract_todos()} function (here replaced with a placeholder) and outputs its result or a message if none are found.
}
