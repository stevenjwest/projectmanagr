\title{Determine File Type}
\usage{
get_file_type(filePath, settings)
}
\arguments{
\item{filePath}{Character string. The full path to the file whose type needs
to be determined. This should be a file within the structured project directory.}

\item{settings}{List. A named list containing project-specific configuration
settings.
The following settings are expected:
\itemize{
\item \code{ProjectPrefixSep}: Separator string between the prefix and the file name.
\item \code{ProjectIndexSep}: Separator string between prefix characters and numbers.
\item \code{GroupNotePrefixSep}: Separator string for major and minor numbering in notes.
\item \code{HeaderNotePrefix}: String indicating the header note's minor numbering.
}}
}
\value{
A character string indicating the file type. Possible values:
\itemize{
\item \code{"DOC"}
\item \code{"NOTE"}
\item \code{"HEAD"}
\item \code{"SUB"}
\item \code{"UNKNOWN"}
}
}
\description{
Identifies the type of file based on its file path, naming conventions,
and organizational settings. The function distinguishes between project
documents, notes, and their subtypes.
}
\details{
The function parses the \code{filePath} and compares its naming and location
against expected patterns based on \code{settings}. It evaluates the prefix
and other components to classify the file into one of the following types:
\itemize{
\item \code{"DOC"}: A project document.
\item \code{"NOTE"}: A simple note.
\item \code{"HEAD"}: A header note.
\item \code{"SUB"}: A sub-note.
\item \code{"UNKNOWN"}: A file that does not match any known project file type.
}

The function uses the following logic:
\itemize{
\item Project documents are identified by mismatches between the prefix and the
parent directory name.
\item Header notes are identified by specific substrings in the prefix
(e.g., \code{"-00~_"}).
\item Sub-notes are identified by additional separators in their prefixes and the
naming of their parent directories.
\item Simple notes are identified by the presence of a single separator in their
prefixes.
}
}
\note{
This function assumes that the project directory structure adheres to the naming conventions
defined in the \code{settings} parameter. Misconfigured settings or unconventional file names
may lead to incorrect classifications.
}
\examples{
# Example settings
settings <- list(
  ProjectPrefixSep = "~_",
  ProjectIndexSep = "~",
  GroupNotePrefixSep = "-",
  HeaderNotePrefix = "00"
)

# Example file path
filePath <- "/project/directory/ABC~001~_file.Rmd"

# Determine file type
get_file_type(filePath, settings)

\item \code{\link{basename}} and \code{\link{dirname}} for extracting components of file paths.
