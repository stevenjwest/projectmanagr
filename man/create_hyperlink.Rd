\usage{
create_hyperlink(toFileName, toFilePath, fromFilePath)
}
\arguments{
\item{toFileName}{Character. The display text of the hyperlink (e.g., \code{"note-001"}).
Typically derived from the filename prefix or a custom label.}

\item{toFilePath}{Character. Full or relative path to the \strong{target} \code{.Rmd} file.
This is the destination file the link should point to.}

\item{fromFilePath}{Character. Full or relative path to the \strong{source} \code{.Rmd} file.
This is the file where the hyperlink will be inserted.}
}
\value{
A character string containing a properly formatted Markdown hyperlink,
e.g., \code{"[note-001](notes/note-001.Rmd)"}.
}
\description{
Generates a Markdown-formatted hyperlink pointing from one R Markdown file
(\code{fromFilePath}) to another (\code{toFilePath}). The visible link text is specified
by \code{toFileName}. The link target is computed as a relative path from the source
file to the destination file, and then minimally cleaned to remove leading
\verb{../} segments for more concise Rmd hyperlink rendering.
