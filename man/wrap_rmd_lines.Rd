\title{Wrap R Markdown lines to a fixed width}
\usage{
wrap_rmd_lines(lines, width = 80)
}
\arguments{
\item{lines}{A character vector of R Markdown lines to be wrapped.}

\item{width}{Maximum number of characters allowed per line (default is 80).}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same content, with long lines wrapped to the specified width.
}
\description{
This function wraps a character vector of R Markdown lines so that no line exceeds
a given character width (default: 80), while preserving indentation and R Markdown
bullet/list formatting. Bullet points and numbered lists are wrapped with a hanging
indent. Lines that appear to contain preformatted content (e.g., tables, ASCII
separators, or Markdown links with no spaces) are left untouched to avoid corrupting
their structure.
}
\examples{
lines <- c(
  "* Here is a very long bullet point that needs to be wrapped because it goes beyond 80 characters.",
  "    + This is a sub-bullet with additional text that also exceeds the line length limit.",
  "",
  "        - Markdown links like [example](https://example.com/very/long/url) are left as-is."
)
cat(paste(wrap_rmd_lines(lines), collapse = "\n"))

}
