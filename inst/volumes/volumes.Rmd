# VOLUMES MANAGEMENT


External Volumes used for data storage on Workstation : _WORKSTATION_


External Volumes can be:
    

* *Data Servers:*

    - Any computer that can be accessed externally, and has disk space for data storage
    
    - The preferred access route is via ssh: As this also enables sshfs and rsync tools to manage data
    

* *External Drives:*

    - Including external Hard Drives (HDDs), external Solid State Drives (SSDs), pen drives
    
        - Typically connected by USB
        
    - BluRay disks may also be used for ARCHIVING of data
    
        - Connected to system with bluray drive via USB



This document defines every External Volume where data is stored within this projectmanagr Organisation.


* Mounts of External Volumes to this system are documented

    - SETUP mount to External Volume
    
        - Typically mount to `~/vols/` sub-directory
        
        - Then form symlinks to specific locations within the External Volume 
        
            -  This ensures data can be effectively accessed in the Rmd && html documentation
    
            - Maintains local RELATIVE links across systems



Data can then be accessed in Project Notes with local relative symlinks from volumes/ symlinks


* Each workstation where this ProjectManagr Organisation is hosted should setup the mount points & symlinks in volumes/ for Project Notes to consistently access resources from External Volumes


* This system ensures all data linked to ProjectManagr Organisation is consistently accessed

    + Ensures the Rmd && HTML Documentation can access data for rendering analysis

# DATA SERVER - WINSTOR


* WINSTOR is the main data storage server at SWC 

    + NOTE : for fast access to data stored here should NOT use SWC VPN
    
        - This slows the internet speed from 65 Mbps to ~1 Mbps at home!!!
        
    + SO - use the SWC SSH server for access
    
        - Check connection and winstor mount on SWC SSH server with `ssh`
        
            - EXTERNAL : Mount locally with `sshfs`
            
            - INTERNAL : Use `mount` command and /etc/fstab



* Bash script will mount winstor via SWC SSH server @ `/nfs/winstor` to SP5 @ `/home/sjwest/vols/winstor`

    + Then symlinks have been formed from directories in winstor to locations in this ORGS volumes/ dir.



----



## MOUNT


To Mount:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# MOUNT WINSTOR:
m-winstor # convenience script - in /home/sjwest/bin
  
```



* When WINSTOR is mounted, following Symlinks in `volumes/` will become active:

    + symlink_name : /location/on/mount/point
    

---


To Un-Mount:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# UN-MOUNT WINSTOR:
u-winstor # convenience script - in /home/sjwest/bin/

```


----



## PROCESS


Once Mounted, can process data 


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# SSH
 # for sending scripts to server
 # must be able to access the system WITHOUT A PASSWORD - using ssh keys: ssh-copy-id
ssh USER@SERVER "bash -s > results.out 2>&1" < path/to/script.sh &
  # this will start the process in the background, and will continue even if the ssh connection is broken!

# to pass args to the script use '--':
ssh USER@SERVER "bash -s > results.out 2>&1" -- < path/to/script.sh "arg1" "arg2" &


# NOHUP
 # for interactive bash session - make a process immune to hang-ups (no_h-up!)
ssh USER@SERVER # connect to the server
nohup cmd & # run the command with nohup
 # RUN IN BACKGROUND WITH &
 # generates output file: nohup.out in current dir with all outputs of cmd


# TMUX
 # for interactive sessions
ssh USER@SERVER # connect to the server
tmux # start tmux session
 # to rename session: ctrl + b + $ -> type NAME
 # detach from session: ctrl + b, d
tmux ls # list all sessions
tmux attach-session -t NAME # attach session NAME


# rstudio-server
 # if running rstudio server, can use the terminal or console in the http interface to run scripts

```

## Mount Setup


* This Server is mounted via `sshfs`

    + connect to any vpn - create a bash script to automate this process
    
    + Setup/check `ssh` access to server
    
    + setup `sshfs` mount from server home dir to a mount point  - create a bash script to automate this process
    
    + un-mount `sshfs` using `fusermount` (or `umount`) - create a bash script to automate this process


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# EXAMPLE - edit as appropriate to mount server:

# Connect to any VPN to access the server - eg.:
vpn-INST-connect.sh # bash script in ~/bin and in $PATH
 # INST - institute code
 # connect to swc vpn with netExtender
 # connect to ucl vpn with openconnect


# CHECK ssh access
ssh USER@SERVER
 # USER@SERVER is the user@server-name for ssh access


# Manually setup mount using sshfs:
sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions USER@SERVER:/home/USER/ ~/vols/SERVER
 # mounting the server FROM:  /home/USER/
  # RECOMMEND to use HOME DIR - then mount other resources to dirs on this system here
 # mounting the server TO:    ~/vols/SERVER
  # Prefer mounting to HOME DIR in vols/ directory
   # make sure ~/vols/ EXISTS!

# Put this into a bash script for easy mounting - place into $PATH (eg. ~/bin)
INST-mount-SERVER.sh # this should call the above sshfs command - convenience script


# Manually un-mount - umount or fusermount (for FUSE [Filesystem in Userspace])
fusermount -u ~/vols/SERVER
 
# Put this into a bash script for easy un-mounting - place into $PATH (eg. ~/bin)
INST-umount-SERVER.sh # this should un-mount using command above - convenience script

```

# EXTERNAL VOLUME : DRIVE - NAME



## MOUNT


This External Volume is mounted by:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# EXAMPLE - edit as appropriate to mount HD:

# FIRST connect the NAME External Hard Drive via USB to this computer

 # NAME External Hard Drive should AUTOMATICALLY mount - location of the mount in the filesystem:

  # /mnt/NAME/ Fill this with the mount location!


# To MOUNT:
 # connect the Drive via USB

# To UNMOUNT:
 # unmount the drive from Finder, and disconnect the Drive via USB

```



## SYMLINKS

The following symlinks have been made FROM the mount-point TO this orgs `volumes/` directory:


```{bash,eval=FALSE}

# SYMLINKS to volumes/

# EXAMPLES - edit as appropriate to setup symlinks:

# SYMLINK TO external 8TB drive at ROOT - to connect with old Oxford data:
ln -s /Volumes/tiler/vols/8TB /Users/stevenwest/00_ELN/volumes/8TB


```


---



# CHEATSHEET


```{bash}


# FIRST - MOUNT EXTERNAL VOLUMES

# External Drives should AUTOMATICALLY mount - identify the location of the mount in the filesystem
  # it may be in: /mnt/ /Volumes/ /media/ 

# connect to External workstation via sshfs - replace USER SERVER
  # mount the HOME DIR of your User Account on Workstation to appropriate MountPoint
  # use SERVER as name of mount

sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions USER@SERVER:/home/USER/ /mnt/SERVER

  # To minimise mounts, mount only to the Workstation, and form mounts in Workstation HOME DIR to:
    # Any other Data Servers, Drives, etc.
  # Then - only need to mount Workstation HOME DIR, and can access all these mounts!
    # Use Workstation FSTAB for automatic mounting:
      # /etc/fstab - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html

  # To easily connect to an External Volume, should add the sshfs command(s) to a bash script:
    # put this in ~/bin/mount-volumes-projectmanagr.sh
    # add to path, and can run the script from bash command line

# To disconnect:
umount /mnt/SERVER
  # again add this to a Script - umount-volumes-projectmanagr.sh 



# NEXT - FORM SYMLINKS to volumes/ Dir

# Form symlink from External Volume Location to the volumes/ dir in ProjectManagr Org:
  # DRIVE represents NAME of MOUNT
  # USER represents the username

# link to the DRIVE at its ROOT:
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/ /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/DRIVE

# link to a sub-dir in DRIVE:
  # DIRVE is a Workstation mounted at USER HOME DIR
  # mnt/winstor - this is a mount in USER HOME DIR to a SEPARATE DATA SERVER that is on DRIVE!
  # name the link winstor
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/mnt/winstor /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/winstor


```


* Now can create sub-dirs in any Project Note DIR for External Data Storage:

    + RECOMMEND: Use projectmanagr ADDIN: `AddinCreateVolumeDir()`

    + Can also run from R console `projectmanagr::volumes_mkdir()`


---



# Mounting External Volumes


Before an External Volume can be used for data storage it must be mounted.


* Here External Volumes refers to ANY external resource for data storage:

    + External Hard Drives
    
    + Pen Drives
    
    + Data Servers
    
    + Workstation Computers
    

Mounting on UNIX-based systems can be achieved with a number of tools:


* `mount` : use to mount any connected external drive

    + In general this is automatically performed by the OS when an external drive is connected
    
    + The external drive is mounted to a standard mount point:  `/mnt/` `/Volumes/` `/media/` etc
    
        - Should identify the mount point to form SYMLINKS in Next Step!


* `sshfs` : any system which can be accessed via `ssh` can have part of its file system mounted with `sshfs`

    + Extremely useful and SECURE - once `ssh` access has been established, can mount with `sshfs`
    
    + RECOMMENDED for Workstations - this allows data storage and data processing management via one server application - `ssh`.
    

---



# Symlink External Volumes to volumes/ Dir


* Forming symlinks from an External Volumes has two advantages:

    + Can select a sub-dir in External Volume to store the projectmanagr data
    
        - Can keep projectmanagr data separate from other data stored on the External Volume
    
    + Can select multiple locations in External Volume for different storge locations:
    
        - These might be a SEPARATE MOUNTS to other Data Servers or External Drives!
        
        - Therefore can use a single External Volume as a Gateway to other Volumes


On UNIX-based systems form symlinks with the `ln-s` command:


```{bash}


# Form symlink from External Volume Location to the volumes/ dir in ProjectManagr Org:
  # DRIVE represents NAME of MOUNT
  # USER represents the username

# link to the DRIVE at its ROOT:
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/ /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/DRIVE

# link to a sub-dir in DRIVE:
  # mnt/winstor - this is a mount to a SEPARATE DATA SERVER that is on DRIVE!
  # name the link winstor
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/mnt/winstor /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/winstor

```


Once symlinks have been setup, whenever the external drive is connected, the symlink will automatically become visible and active


---



# Symlink volumes/ DIR to Project Note Sub-Dir


* Finally, to create External Storage that will automatically appear in a Project Note DIR when mounted, need to symlink a volumes/ DIR to a Project Note sub-dir

    + To ensure the data is stored correctly on an external volume need to MIRROR the whole ProjectManagr Organisation:  PROGRAMME / PROJECT_DIR / PROJECT_NOTE_DIR / sub-dir /
    
        - Necessary to ensure the External Volume can be used to store data across PROGRAMMES, PROJECTS and PROJECT NOTES

    + This requires careful handling:
    
        - First the full dir tree needs to be generated down to the new sub-dir on the Volume selected.
        
        - Then an appropriate relative Symlink needs to be formed from this new sub-dir on the Volume, to location inside the Project Note DIR.
        

* This is handled by the `projectmanagr::volumes_mkdir()` command:

    + Requires:
    
        - The sub-dir NAME - NO SPACES
      
        - the Project Note path (can extract Project Note DIR from this)
        
        - The Name of the Volume to store the new sub-dir on

    + An RSTUDIO ADDIN will allow this to be easily called using guaranteed valid inputs:
    
        - NO SPACES in sub-dir name
        
        - Run with Project Note selected, its validity can be confirmed
        
        - Only EXISTING AND VISIBLE SYMLINKS in the volumes/ directory can be selected form a dropdown box.



---



# External Data Processing


If data is stored on a Workstation mounted via `sshfs`, it is also possible to process this data on this workstation using `ssh` access to run bash scripts.


* Can use local machine to connect to Workstation via ssh, initiate an analysis script, and disconnect from the Workstation to leave the script to run by using `nohup` with ssh:

    + `ssh -n me@example.com "nohup MyScript.sh >./nohup.out 2>./nohup.err &"`
    
        - Can even run this from an Rmd bash chunk!  
        
            - So can document code run on Workstation in Project Notes!
        
        - This connects via ssh, then runs the nohup command, referencing a local script
        
        - MUST ensure ALL datastreams are redirected (`>` and `2>`) and nohup runs in background (`&`)
